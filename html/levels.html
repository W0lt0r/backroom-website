        <h2>Level 0</h2>
        <p2>Description: This is the starting level of the Backrooms, and it's what most people picture when they think of the Backrooms. It consists of mono-yellow, wallpapered walls, old, stained carpeting, and the constant buzzing of fluorescent lights.
        Dangers: While Level 0 is mostly safe, prolonged exposure can lead to feelings of unease, paranoia, and auditory hallucinations.</p2>

        <p2>Level 1
        Description: Similar to Level 0 but begins to feel more "off." The rooms are still endless, but the wallpaper may begin to decay, and there might be the sound of distant footsteps or whispers. Some rooms might be darker than others, and there's a feeling of being watched.
        Dangers: Increased risk of paranoia and auditory hallucinations. There are reports of entities or creatures in this level, though direct encounters are rare.</p2>

        <p2>Level 2
        Description: The environment becomes more industrial. Instead of wallpapered rooms, you might find yourself in old office spaces, abandoned libraries, or moldy storage areas. The hum of fluorescent lights is replaced by the echoing drip of water from leaky ceilings.
        Dangers: Encounters with hostile entities become more common. It's advised to avoid making loud noises and to be cautious of dark areas.</p2>

        Level 3
        Description: A drastic change from the previous levels. This level is a labyrinth of tight, maintenance tunnels, boiler rooms, and industrial spaces. The temperature here is noticeably warmer, and the air feels heavy.
        Dangers: This level is home to more aggressive entities. Tight spaces also mean that escaping from threats can be more challenging.

        Level 4
        Description: Resembles old, abandoned office buildings. There are long, dark hallways, empty office rooms, and broken elevators. Some areas might have no lighting at all, making it essential to have a light source.
        Dangers: Hostile entities are frequent in this level. It's recommended to stay quiet and avoid any unlit areas.

        Level 5
        Description: Appears to be a series of vast, open spaces, with large pillars supporting a seemingly infinite ceiling. The floor is covered in inches of water, and the whole area is shrouded in thick mist. It's easy to get disoriented here.
        Dangers: Aside from the usual entities, there's a risk of getting lost due to the mist and vastness of the area. Some claim there are aquatic threats in the water, though these reports are unconfirmed.
        It's worth noting that the lore around the Backrooms is ever-evolving, with new levels and entities being added by the community. The levels mentioned above are some of the more "canonical" ones, but many variations and sublevels exist within the Backrooms mythos.</p2>
