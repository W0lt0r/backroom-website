                <h2>The journey begins in what appears to be an ordinary, albeit rundown, office space. The walls are a sickly yellow, and the fluorescent lights emit a constant, 
                    unsettling hum. The air is damp, and there's a faint smell of mildew in the air. It's disorienting and eerie, as if you've stumbled into a forgotten part of the world.</h2></td>

                    <h2>As you venture deeper, the environment becomes even more surreal. The walls seem to stretch endlessly in all directions, and the buzzing of the lights grows 
                        louder. You'll encounter strange and unsettling sights, including abandoned furniture and forgotten remnants of human presence.</h2></td>

                <h2>Here, the monotony continues, but you'll notice subtle changes. The walls may take on a different color, and the lighting can shift, casting eerie shadows. The 
                    sense of isolation and disorientation deepens as you become more aware that you're far from any familiar place.</h2></td>

                    <h2>By this point, you've likely lost track of time and direction. The corridors may twist and turn, leading you further into the maze-like structure. The air 
                        becomes colder, and strange sounds echo through the empty halls, keeping you on edge.</h2></td>

                    The feeling of being watched becomes palpable, heightening your sense of unease.</h2></td>

                    <h2>At this stage, you'll find yourself questioning reality itself. The laws of physics seem to bend, and the environment becomes increasingly surreal. Reality 
                        itself appears to be crumbling around you, and the Backrooms take on a dream-like, nightmarish quality.</h2></td>

                <h2>By Level 7, the concept of time loses all meaning. Days and nights blend together, and you may experience vivid and disturbing hallucinations. The boundaries 
                    between your own mind and the Backrooms themselves blur, making it difficult to discern what is real.</h2></td>

                    <h2>In this deeper level, you'll confront more malevolent entities that inhabit the Backrooms. These entities are often described as distorted and nightmarish, and
                         they seem to be drawn to intruders like you. Survival becomes a real challenge.</h2></td>

                <h2>The penultimate level is a place of profound dread. The architecture becomes increasingly surreal and incomprehensible. The very nature of the Backrooms seems to 
                    defy logic, and the deeper you go, the more it becomes apparent that escape is nearly impossible.</h2></td>

                    <h2>The final and most enigmatic level is shrouded in mystery. It is said that those who reach Level 10 experience a kind of transcendence, where the boundaries 
                        between reality and the Backrooms vanish entirely. What lies beyond Level 10, if anything, remains a subject of speculation and fear.</h2></td>
