                <h2>Entity0 is often considered the gateway entity, appearing in the basic yellow maze-like rooms that make up the initial layers of the Backrooms. It manifests as a 
                    subtle hum emanating from the discolored walls, instilling unease in those who hear it.</h2></td>

                    the distant sound of footsteps that never seem to grow closer.</h2></td>

                        razor-sharp teeth. Its eyes are often described as too large for its face and unblinking, adding to its eerie demeanor.</h2></td>
