                <h2>Entity0 is the most basic level of the Backrooms. It is often described as a seemingly endless maze of yellow, windowless rooms with old, discolored wallpaper and \
a nauseating smell of moist carpet. Time seems to flow differently here, disorienting newcomers. The air is heavy, and the fluorescent lights above flicker intermittently.</h2></td>

                <h2>In contrast, Entity1 is far more unsettling. It introduces environmental hazards such as rooms that are perpetually on fire or covered in a mysterious fluid. Some 
explorers have reported hearing distant screams and footsteps that seem to be getting closer but never actually arrive.</h2></td>
